##  Many to Many Example

We have a Post Type Called Movies and it can have Many Actors. However, Actors can also be associated to many movies.

* We could make these both post types and use post meta to save the relationships.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* With the addition of Term Meta, we could make one of these, preferable the one with less metadata a taxonomy.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* We could make them both a Custom Post Type, and use something like Posts 2 Posts to link them together.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* An option we will talk about is shadow taxonomies.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
