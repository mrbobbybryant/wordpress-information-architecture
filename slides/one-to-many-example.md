##  One to Many Example

We have multiple locations and each location will Author itâ€™s own articles. (One-to-Many, One location can have many Posts)

* We could have a post meta dropdown added to the post meta screen, which would allow you to select the location.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* We could create a locations taxonomy, and users could simply select the location similar to how you would select a Category or Tag.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
